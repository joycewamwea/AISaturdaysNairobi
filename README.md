### iris problem

I used a polynomial linear regression classifier.
This is a simple algorithim and since the nature of our problem wasnt very complex,i so it as a good fit.



### digit classification problem

i used a non linear support vector machine so as to capture more complax relationships between the datapoints.
my first go to model was neural networks but it gave me a less accuracy score as compared to svm.
